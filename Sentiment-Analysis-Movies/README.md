# Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews

Sentiment analysis is the process of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text, especially in order to determine whether the writer's attitude towards a particular topic, product, etc. is positive, negative, or neutral.

The movie_review dataset was the first to be used for Sentiment Analysis, and is treated as a standard dataset to compare sentiment accuracies. This dataset is therefore included in the NLTK corpora.

Wordclouds are used to observe a dataset and allow us to observe the issues and challenges associated with sentiment analysis.
